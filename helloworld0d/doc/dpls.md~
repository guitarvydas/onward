Abstract

This paper describes a technique for extending the syntax of programming
languages.

The new syntax consists of drawings containing simple, closed, graphical
figures and arrows.

We use the the name "DPL" - Diagrammatic Programming Languages - when
referring to this class of new programming syntax.

We assert that DPLs might be used *along side* of existing TPLs (Textual
Programming Languages) and that DPLs are hybrids of diagram and textual
notations.

There are multiple possible DPL syntaxes. This paper suggests but a
single DPL syntax. It is assumed that a variety of syntaxes might be
invented, using the techniques described herein.

This paper touches on some of the key aspects of making compilable and
understandable drawings of programs, e.g. 0D, syntactic simplicity, DI
(Design Intent), etc.

We do not discuss fundamental DPL principles in this paper and refer the
reader to other related writings on these subjects.

\[TBD\] This paper is laid out in XXX (???) sections.

The above diagram is a motivating example.

The above diagram shows but one sample of a practical DPL syntax.
Variations and improvements on this syntax can be imagined. The above
syntax is being used to produce actual applications like term-rewriting
(*t2t* text-to-text rewriting) compilers, LLMs, DSLs for creating DSLs,
Visual Shell prototypes, games, etc.

This DPL syntax consists of only a few kinds of closed figures plus
arrows plus text belonging to the closed figures. Everything else is
considered to be a comment, and, is ignored. For example the bold text
"Sequential Routing" is ignored. Colors are ignored. Line shapes and
line widths are ignored, and so on.

This diagram was drawn using the off-the-shelf diagram editor
[draw.io](http://draw.io)\[1\].

The editor saves the diagram in a modified form of XML, called
*graphML*\[2\].

The graphML file can be processed using off-the-shelf tools, like an XML
parser or a PEG-based parser\[3\]\[4\].

In our case, we used the Odin programming language\[5\] and the XML
parsing library that is included in the Odin library\[6\].

We choose not to reproduce the code for the actual diagram parser here,
due to space limitations for this paper. The full source code for the
functioning diagram parser is in an open-source repo\[7\].

The diagram parser produces internal data structures in the host
programming language and/or JSON\[8\] files.

A [[draw.io]{.underline}](http://draw.io) file can contain several
diagrams, each on a separate tab (window) in the editor.

The structure of the information needed by the DPL runtime is minimal,
consisting of about four (4) fields for each diagram:

\"file\": \"helloworld0d.drawio\",

\"name\": \"main\",

\"children\": \[

{

\"name\": \"Echo\",

\"id\": 6

},

\... (2 more children referring to the same template "Echo", but
assigned

Different ids\] \...

\],

\"connections\": \[

{

\"dir\": 0,

\"source\": {

\"name\": \"\",

\"id\": 0

},

\"source_port\": \"\",

\"target\": {

\"name\": \"Echo\",

\"id\": 6

},

\"target_port\": \"\"

},

\... \[7 more connections as per the diagram\] \...

The filename of the [[draw.io]{.underline}](http://draw.io) drawing

The tab-name of the top-most diagram.

A bag of Children components.

A bag of Connections between children (including connections to/from the
parent containing diagram).

Compilation and Execution

Compilation and execution of this DPL consists of the following steps:

1.  Convert DPL program diagrams to JSON![Towards DPLs-1. Convert
    diagram to JSON.drawio.png](./media/image2.png){width="6.5in"
    height="0.9731988188976378in"}

Transpilation of the diagrams (XML) into JSON (or internal data
structures, if efficiency is at a premium). The diagrams represent
*templates* for components.

In our implementation, das2json[^1] is implemented[^2] in the Odin
programming language. The process begins with a straight-forward call to
the XML parsing library. The XML data is then deconstructed into a
convenient internal format (see 0d/ir/ir_odin)

xml, xml_err := xml.parse(file)

> \...

2\. Load component templates from JSON![Towards DPLs-2.
loader.drawio.png](./media/image3.png){width="5.013888888888889in"
height="1.125in"}

Ingestion of the JSON, or internal data structures into an internal
database that we call a *registry* (which can be implemented as a
*dictionary, map* or a *database*).

routings = json.loads(json_data)

> \...

3\. Instantiate system![Towards DPLs-3.
instantiate.drawio.png](./media/image4.png){width="6.5in"
height="2.6686996937882763in"}

Instantiation[^3] of an application beginning with a top-level diagram
and proceeding downwards to instantiate all children components needed
in the top-level diagram and, recursively, instantiating their children.
Components are instantiated based on their DPL templates. Containers are
instantiated by instantiating all child components and all routings
between components. Note that more than one child component can refer to
the same DPL template. Components must be uniquely instantiated -
typically their (x,y) position is enough to differentiate components,
but, [[draw.io]{.underline}](http://draw.io) assigns unique id's to each
template component, which we ended up using instead of relying on (x,y)
graphical information. Assigning unique id's is a convenience, not a
requirement.

\...

> main_container = get_component_instance(pregistry,
> main_container_name,
>
> owner=None)

\...

4\. Inject first message

![Towards DPLs-4 Inject first
message(s).drawio.png](./media/image5.png){width="6.5in"
height="2.4615912073490813in"}

The first message is constructed using the host language. The message is
injected[^4] into the input queue of the top-most component.

\...

> def start_function (root_project, root_0D, arg, main_container):
>
> arg = new_datum_string (arg)
>
> msg = make_message(\"\", arg)
>
> inject (main_container, msg)

\...

5\. Run![Towards DPLs-5.
Run.drawio.png](./media/image6.png){width="6.5in" height="3.25in"}

The application is executed.

The application is interpreted by repeatedly delivering messages along
connections, recursively, until no messages remain in any input queues.

*It is possible to invoke already-written library code written in some
other host language using the active flag - see the code repo for more
details.*

Containers must consume only one input message at a time while waiting
for all children to reach quiescence\[ceptre\].

\...

> if not load_errors:
>
> injectfn (root_project, root_0D, arg, main_container)

\...

6\. Display outputs![Towards DPLs-6. Display
Outputs.drawio.png](./media/image7.png){width="6.5in"
height="2.4516786964129484in"}

The outputs in the output queue of the top-level component are displayed
using the host language.

\...

> dump_outputs (main_container)

\...

The Python version of the runtime system consists of roughly 9 files of
code consisting of about 2,500 lines of code (including blank lines and
comments) and is supported by a standard library consisting of another 5
files of code containing about 430 lines of code.

At the basic level, runtime component instances are asynchronous, but,
use named and anonymous functions and closures, instead of operating
system processes. As such, programs written this way "feel" like
*programs* instead of as *processes* in terms of efficiency.

Principles

We do not discuss the following principles in detail in this paper, due
to reasons of space.

Structured Message Passing

Rule of 7

Parental Authority

No built-in paradigm. Async and ordered-in-time by default.

SEND in addition to CALL

Locality of Reference

Scoping of names

Every diagram is stable, every diagram can be understood on its own.
Children cannot change the behaviour of their parents.

\- All components are asynchronous by default.

\- CPUs are meant to be single-threaded

\- There is no single happy path in many applications

\- Subroutines are not functions

Hidden dependencies

Build-and-forget

LEGOÂ® block-like composition of software components (needs full
isolation).

Modern tooling for developers, breaking free of function-based paradigm.

Building new paradigms using existing tools.

T2t transpilation pipelines.

Future

Compilation to other languages, instead of interpretation.

Parsing XML using OhmJS instead of calling XML parsing libraries.

Testing, unit testing, coverage testing
