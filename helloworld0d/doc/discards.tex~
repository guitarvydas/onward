The astute reader might notice a resemblance of this DPL with electronic components. In electronics, components are called “ICs”, and ports are called “pins”. Container diagrams are akin to “schematics”. ICs are black boxes encased in epoxy or plastic. One cannot peer “inside” of any IC to determine how it is implemented. Templates are called “connection diagrams” (found on IC datasheets). Components in this DPL and electronics ICs share the characteristic that they are completely asynchronous and completely isolated from one another. In contrast, software \emph{functions} and \emph{libraries} are tightly coupled and synchronous.
