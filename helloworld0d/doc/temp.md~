The above diagram is a motivating example.
The above diagram shows but one sample of a practical DPL syntax. Variations and improvements on this syntax can be imagined. The above syntax is being used to produce actual applications like term-rewriting (t2t text-to-text rewriting) compilers, LLMs, DSLs for creating DSLs, Visual Shell prototypes, games, etc.
This DPL syntax consists of only a few kinds of closed figures plus arrows plus text belonging to the closed figures. Everything else is considered to be a comment, and, is ignored.  For example the bold text “Sequential Routing” is ignored. Colors are ignored. Line shapes and line widths are ignored, and so on.
This diagram was drawn using the off-the-shelf diagram editor draw.io[1].
The editor saves the diagram in a modified form of XML, called graphML[2].
