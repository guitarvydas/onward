update: I'm having success converting to acmart latex format by using ChatGPT.

I wrote the content in a WYSIWYG editor (Pages on MacOS)

then exported it to .docx format

then converted the .docx to .md with the following magic:
$ pandoc -f docx --extract-media=./ -t markdown 'Towards DPLs.docx' -o dpls.md

then used this query in ChatGPT "convert the following markdown to acmart latex format:" and pasted the .md file into ChatGPT and copied its output into a file "test3.tex"

then ran
$ pdflatex test3.tex
